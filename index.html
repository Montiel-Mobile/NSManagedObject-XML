<p>This is a category on NSManagedObject that implements KissXML to generate a DDXMLElement object from an NSManagedObject, and to ingest a DDXMLElement object to populate an NSManagedObject and any sub entities (if configured to) to be created and/or sub entities to establish relationships to (either to reference entities/tables or relationship entities within a hierarchy).</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-to-use-it" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HOW TO USE IT</h2>

<p>This category uses the Google Tool Box class for base64 encoding/decoding at <a href="http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/trunk">http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/trunk</a>, specifically GTMStringEncoding, which is included here. Also, the KissXML project at <a href="https://github.com/robbiehanson/KissXML.git">https://github.com/robbiehanson/KissXML.git</a> as a git submodule, so you will need to add /usr/include/libxml2 to your header search paths in the build settings. Apple's SecKeyWrapper sample code at <a href="http://developer.apple.com">http://developer.apple.com</a> is also included here. A DataFormatter singleton which instantiates NSDateFormatter once and reuses it for performance reasons, instead of instantiating it for every use for date processing in this category, is provided as well.</p>

<a name="core-data-userinfo-keys" class="anchor" href="#core-data-userinfo-keys"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Core Data UserInfo Keys</h1>

<p>Use these keys in the user info section when configuring the core data model to enable the associated behavior.</p>

<h2>
<a name="entity-description-userinfo-keys" class="anchor" href="#entity-description-userinfo-keys"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Entity Description UserInfo keys</h2>

<p>'XMLTagName' - value is used as the XML tagname instead of the entity name (optional - used to override the entity name)</p>

<p>'ReferenceKey' - value is the attribute name that is used as the reference table key</p>

<p>'SortedRelationships' - value is unused, it's presence identifies an entity that sorts relationships when ingesting XML. If this key is specified, then the 'SortOrder' below is required on ALL relationships for the entity. This may be required for relationship dependancies by ensuring created sub entities are ingested before relation sub entities (which are not created but instead a relationship is established to previously created sub entities).</p>

<h2>
<a name="attribute-description-userinfo-keys" class="anchor" href="#attribute-description-userinfo-keys"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Attribute Description UserInfo keys</h2>

<p>'encrypted' - value is unused, it's presence identifies encrypted NSStrings (stored as NSData).</p>

<p>'base64' - value is unused, it's presence identifies binary data that is to be base64 encoded for XML.</p>

<p>'exclude' - value is unused, it's presence is used to exclude an attribute from XML expansion by default all attributes will get expanded.</p>

<p>'Format' - value is used as the format for NSDateFormatter, if present. Otherwise the global kDateFormat is used.</p>

<h2>
<a name="relationship-description-userinfo-keys" class="anchor" href="#relationship-description-userinfo-keys"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Relationship Description UserInfo keys</h2>

<p>'Expand' - value is unused, it's presence identifies a relationship that will be XML expanded. By default no relationships will get expanded.</p>

<p>'CreateEntity' - value is unused, it's presence is used to create the relationship entity when ingesting XML.</p>

<p>'Reference' - value is unused, it's presence is used to identify the relationship to a reference table (does not create the relationship entity).</p>

<p>'Relation' - value is unused, it's presence is used to identify the relationship to an entity within the hierarchy structure (does not create the relationship entity).</p>

<p>'SortOrder' - value is a number that indicates the order to sort the relationships of the entity.</p>
